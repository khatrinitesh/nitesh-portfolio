  experience: [
    {
      company: "ADSMN",
      role: "Senior React Frontend UI Developer",
      duration: "2023 - Present",
      description: `As a Senior React Frontend UI Developer at ADSMN, I designed and implemented highly responsive and scalable user interfaces using React and TypeScript, 
leveraging modern state management tools like Zustand to build maintainable and performant applications. 
I collaborated closely with backend developers and UI/UX designers to ensure seamless integration of APIs 
and visually appealing user experiences. My work included optimizing page load times, reducing rendering latency, 
and improving overall frontend performance by 100%, ensuring smooth and efficient workflows for users. 
I also applied best practices in code architecture, modular component design, testing, and responsive layouts, 
enabling the team to rapidly deliver high-quality features while maintaining code reliability and scalability. 
This role strengthened my expertise in frontend development, performance optimization, and system design, 
while reinforcing effective communication and collaborative skills in a fast-paced, professional environment.`,
